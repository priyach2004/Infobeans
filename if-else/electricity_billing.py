1. Electricity Department Billing System


The electricity department of a city wants to automate the monthly bill generation process for its customers. The bill is calculated based on slab-wise unit consumption:

* First 100 units are charged at ₹5 per unit
* Next 100 units (101–200) are charged at ₹7 per unit
* Units above 200 are charged at ₹10 per unit

Write a Python program to calculate the total electricity bill based on the number of units consumed.

Input:
Enter units consumed: 250

Output:
Total Electricity Bill: ₹1950
'''

units = int(input("Enter units consumed: "))
bill = 0
if units<=100:
	bill = units*5
elif units<=200:
	units = 200-100
	bill = 500+(units*7)
else:
	units = units-200
	bill = 500+700+(units*10)
print(f"Total Electricity Bill: ₹{bill}")
