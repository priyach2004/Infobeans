12. Restaurant Bill with GST System

A restaurant applies GST based on the total bill amount:

* Up to ₹1000 → 5% GST
* ₹1001 to ₹5000 → 12% GST
* Above ₹5000 → 18% GST
  Additionally, if the bill exceeds ₹3000, a service charge of ₹200 is added.

Write a Python program to calculate the final bill.

Input:
Enter bill amount: 4000

Output:
Final Bill Amount: ₹4680
'''

bill = int(input("Enter bill amount: "))
gst = None
if bill<1000:
	gst = bill*(5/100)
elif 1001<=bill<=5000:
	gst = bill*(12/100)
else:
	gst = bill*(18/100)
if bill>3000:
	gst = gst+200
print(f"Final Bill Amount: ₹{gst+bill}")
