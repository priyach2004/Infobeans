2. Hospital Emergency Priority System

A hospital assigns treatment priority based on age, severity, and insurance.

If severity is critical, then check age. If age is 60 or above, assign Immediate ICU; otherwise assign Emergency Ward.

If severity is moderate, then check insurance. If insured, assign Priority Treatment; otherwise assign General Queue.

If severity is low, then check age. If age is less than 10, assign Pediatric Priority; otherwise assign Wait.

Input:
Age = 65
Severity = critical
Insurance = yes

Output:
Treatment = Immediate ICU
