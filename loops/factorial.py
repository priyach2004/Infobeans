2. Factorial of a Number
In project scheduling, tasks are dependent on previous tasks, and the total number of ways to arrange them is calculated using factorial. Factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
Write a program to calculate the *factorial of a given number using loops*.

Input: n = 5
Output: Total Ways = 120
'''

n = int(input("Number: "))
fact=1

'''
for i in range(1,n+1):
	fact = fact*i
'''

i=1
while i<=n:
    fact = fact*i
    i += 1
print(f"Total Ways: {fact}")
