8. Count Multiples of 5 Between Two Numbers
A supermarket gives coupons to customers whose token numbers are multiples of 5. The manager enters a token range and wants to know how many eligible token numbers exist.
Write a program to count numbers divisible by 5 between two given numbers using loops.

Input:
1 20

Output:
Count = 4
'''

n1,n2 = map(int,input("Enter a number: ").split(","))
i=n1
num=5
count = 0

for i in range(1,n2+1):
    if i%5==0:
        count += 1
    i += 1
'''
while i<=n2:
'''

print(f"Count: {count}")
